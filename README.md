# Python Project Documentation

## Project Overview
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with self-attention mechanisms for image classification on the CIFAR10 dataset. The architecture and training process are designed to be modular, allowing for easy adjustments and enhancements.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into several directories and files, each serving a specific purpose:

```
python-project
├── config
│   └── config.py          # Configuration settings for training parameters and device
├── data
│   ├── __init__.py        # Initialization file for the data module
│   └── data_loader.py      # Data loading and preprocessing functions
├── models
│   ├── __init__.py        # Initialization file for the models module
│   └── model.py           # CNN model implementation with self-attention
├── training
│   ├── __init__.py        # Initialization file for the training module
│   ├── train.py           # Training functions for the model
│   └── evaluate.py        # Evaluation functions for model performance
├── utils
│   ├── __init__.py        # Initialization file for the utils module
│   └── visualization.py    # Visualization functions for metrics and predictions
├── main.py                # Main execution script to run the project
├── requirements.txt       # List of dependencies required for the project
└── README.md              # Project documentation
```

## Installation
To set up the project, clone the repository and install the required dependencies. You can do this by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
1. **Configuration**: Modify the `config/config.py` file to adjust training parameters such as batch size, number of epochs, learning rate, and dataset root.

2. **Data Loading**: The `data/data_loader.py` file contains functions to load and preprocess the CIFAR10 dataset. You can customize the data transformations as needed.

3. **Model Implementation**: The CNN model is defined in `models/model.py`. You can modify the architecture or add new layers as required.

4. **Training**: The training process is handled in `training/train.py`. You can run the training loop by executing the `main.py` script.

5. **Evaluation**: After training, you can evaluate the model's performance using the functions defined in `training/evaluate.py`.

6. **Visualization**: Use the functions in `utils/visualization.py` to visualize training metrics, predictions, and attention maps.

## Running the Project
To run the project, execute the following command:

```bash
python main.py
```

This will load the data, initialize the model, perform training, evaluate the model, and visualize the results.
